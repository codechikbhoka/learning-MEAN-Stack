In the previous module we built an express application from scratch. We wrote the entire code. We cobbled up the code together and made it work and serve up the rest API. Of course there must be a faster rate of building an express application when we need to get one to go as quickly as possible. This is where the express generator come to our rescue. The express generator is a global MPM module which when installed will allow you to quickly scaffold out an entire skeleton for an express application. Thereafter all we need to do is fill in the missing details and you will have a full fledged express application query to go.
